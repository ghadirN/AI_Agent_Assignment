The Cozy Oven is a rustic patisserie specializing in the art of laminated doughs and slow-fermented treats. Our mission is to encourage "slow-living" through the consumption of high-quality, artisanal pastries crafted with patience and care. From our 72-hour sourdough croissants to our signature seasonal fruit tarts, we believe that the best things in life take time to fold.

Founded on the principles of warmth and community, we offer a cozy sanctuary for those looking to escape the hustle of daily life. Beyond our daily bakes, we provide custom event catering and "Pastry Pairing" consultations. Every visit to our shop includes a complimentary "Cozy Card"—a hand-printed note featuring a poem or positive thought—to ensure our customers leave with a nourished soul as well as a full stomach.
